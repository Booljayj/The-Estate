Yields the Stoic Barbute once defeated.

It is what is commonly known as a "gargoyle", though this terminology is incorrect. Gargoyles are water spouts (as in gargle), normal statues are called Grotesques.

Parts of it can be broken off. Fights differently depending on which parts have been destroyed.

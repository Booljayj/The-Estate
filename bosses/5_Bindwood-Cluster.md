Yields the Frigid Emblem once defeated.

The arena is a circular room with tightly-packed and interwoven trees forming the walls. The Bindwood Cluster looks like a collection of vines coming up out of the ground in the middle of the arena. Only this central cluster can be damaged, any appendages lost don't affect it.

Can create "shells" of ice to surround itself, then launch these shells towards the player. Can dig roots into the ground to form spikes which damage the player.

Yields the Runed Mace when defeated.

The Chimera is created by the player in [[The Tower]]. There are three vats of glowing liquid that are combined into a central vessel, inside of which the chimera forms. It's body is highly fluid, mutating in response to the player's attacks. For instance, growing fireproof plating, or thicker skin, or electrodes on its back that can redirect lightning.

## Notes
- The only boss which is actually created by the player in order to fight
- This boss will be much easier to fight if the player has more weapons, as they can switch as soon as it reacts to their current weapon.

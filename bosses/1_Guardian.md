Yields the Ancient Sword once defeated.

Fought using no weapons, as this is the first boss in the game. Use his own strength and the environment around you against him.

## Notes
- Inspired by The Pursuer from Dark Souls 2
- Wields the Ancient Sword, which is dropped point-first into the ground when he is defeated.

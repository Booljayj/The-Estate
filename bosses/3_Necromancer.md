Yields the shield to the player during the fight. Use it to finally defeat her.

After an initial attack pattern, the Necromancer will go down pretty easily. When downed, the shield will drop, and fight will seem to be over. While picking up the shield, the Necromancer will suddenly reform and attack. The first phase of the second fight will need to be a tutorial on how to use the shield, so the Necro should be invulnerable unless the shield is used properly.

## Notes
- This is technically two fights. A first one where she has the shield, and another after she loses it.

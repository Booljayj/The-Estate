Yields the Charged Implement once defeated.

A machine formed from many interlocking parts. The Automaton can switch between several modes, each of which has a different set of attacks. She is highly resistant to any kind of damage, except during certain specific attacks and cooldowns. The player will need to learn when to attack in order to make any headway in defeating her.

When at the last bit of her health, the Automaton will switch to a unique mode that will cast herself and the player into the Stellar Abyss. She will stay that way until defeated. Once she is, the player can use the newly found Charged Implement to activate a piece of her body, which will return them to the normal level.

## Notes
- Many of the windups for her attacks will be indicated with color-changing lights on her body.
- The term "automaton" has been around since at least 1200CE, so it would not be out of place to find it in the medieval era.

The true final boss of the game.

The Mirror Wraith is a being composed of all of the "improvements" that The Master made to himself. The Master made many improvements to himself over the course of his life, giving himself greater strength, speed, and vitality. These improvements made his own soul very unstable. Eventually, after continuing to alter himself trying to solve this problem, the instability killed him. His soul tore into two parts, one which contained his original self, and the other which was made from all the accumulated alterations he had made. His original self quickly died of old age, while the other part, now known as the Mirror Wraith, continued his obsessive work of exploring the deepest aspects of the soul. However, the wraith was much less concerned for the rest of humanity, and started using children to fuel incredibly powerful creations. He created the mirror world, as well as the more powerful versions of all the creatures The Master had made.

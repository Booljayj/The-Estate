Yields the Cuirass once defeated.

The player never sees the body of the hydra, only the many oily tentacles that it attacks with. When defeated, it tries one last attack, hurling a large ball of muck towards the player. After that, it retreats and is never seen again. It is the only boss that does not actually die. The cuirass is hidden in the ball of muck that it throws, unknown to the Hydra.

# Areas

- Graveyard
 - The graveyard is a dense collection of gravestones and small tombs. It is built around a hill, on many discrete levels. Stairways and fences connect and separate different areas in the graveyard.
- Cathedral
 - At the very top of the hill, at the center of the graveyard, is a cathedral. It is a small building, one large room. It is in good repair, with a somber atmosphere. A hidden mechanism opens a doorway to the embalming room.
- Embalming Room
 - A large room underneath the cathedral. It serves as the gateway between the cathedral and the catacombs. It is filled pillars with arches between them, and about .5m of water covers the floor. The patterned floor is visible under the water, worn away at some areas. There are several small rooms which surround the main chamber, containing bodies at various stages of preparation.
- Catacombs
 - A series of branching tunnels that form a rough triple helix, leading down deep underneath the graveyard. It is filled with traps of various sorts, and only a few enemy encounters. The floor and walls are worn stone, with spaces for coffins inset into the walls.
- Bone Pit
 - Deep under the catacombs is a large cavern filled with bones. They form a rough floor which the character can walk around in, with low mounds to navigate. It is impossibly deep, and bones all the way down. The only way into the pit is to fall through a hole, and there is only one way out (through a trapped-filled passageway).

# Obstacles

- Shallow Water
 - Impedes movement speed. Run is replaced with a walk, and sprinting results in run. Not possible to climb or leap, vaulting is still possible.
- Dart Traps
 - A wall of launchers that periodically emits darts. Darts cause minor damage unless blocked. Can be blocked with shield. Usually placed at one end of a long hallway to maximize effectiveness.
- Spike Traps
 - Spikes erupt from walls and floor if a trigger is pressed (usually floor pressure switch). Causes massive damage.
- Smasher Traps
 - Massive stone blocks smash down from the ceiling to the floor periodically. If caught underneath, causes instant death. Blocks movement through hallways if turned off.
- Pits
 - Upper levels are filled with pits that lead all the way down to the base. If you fall into one of these, youâ€™re going to have a bad time. Some are filled with water and spikes.
- Darkness
 - Many areas of the crypts are very dark, where the character cannot see far in front of themselves. Combined with the shallow water and pits, this becomes a very dangerous obstacle.

# Barriers

- Trap Gears
 - A set of gears that controls a nearby trap. Can be iced to stop the trap for a short time. Usually used for smasher and dart traps. Can be used to pass otherwise deadly hallways.
- Trap Engines
 - A trap engine can be activated with lightning to activate a set of traps. Once activated, cannot be deactivated. Can open passageways by activating a smasher trap that is blocking it.
- Thick Cobwebs
 - Cobwebs block movement unless destroyed with fire (revise- real webs fireproof)
- Brittle Pillars
 - When broken with the mace, the pillars can cause a section of the ceiling to fall down. Many pillars may need to be broken before the ceiling falls. Can create a path up - if the fallen ceiling leads up to another floor - or a path down - if the piece of ceiling smashes through the floor below.
- Shallow Water
 - Shallow water can be iced to run over the top. Can be used to leap or climb, or cross large watery gaps.
- Torches
 - Torches can be lit with the fire gem to light up dark areas. Some torches are connected, so lighting one will cause a chain reaction which lights them all. Some enemies will flee from the light. Once lit, torches stay lit forever.

# Enemies

# Bosses

- Necromancer
 - Found at the lowest level, the bone pit. Gives the player the shield.
- Embalmer
 - Found multiple times. Locks down a room until beaten (with barriers made of bone). Will continually create minor enemies until defeated.

## Areas
The Master's Chambers are located above the manor, in midair. Sections of the chambers phase into existence as the player draws near, and they are invisible and intangible otherwise. Some sections will appear to "build" themselves, or shift once they are visible into a different configuration. Everything is made of an obsidian-black stone, with veins of bright glowing blue. The blue veins are sometimes arranged to form runes, and are sometimes random.

The chambers can only be accessed once the player has used each weapon on the Seal and defeated the challenge.

- Seal
 - The seal is a large golden circle, divided into six distinct segments. Each segment bears a different set of designs which correspond to one of the weapons the player will collect. If the player strikes the seal with one of the weapons, it will initiate a challenge, where the player must use only that weapon to defeat 3 waves of enemies. Once a challenge is completed for a weapon, the corresponding segment of the seal with crack, with white light spilling out from the cracks. When all challenges are complete, the whole seal with explode with a flash of light, and the path to the spiral stair will be revealed.
- Spiral Stair
 - The spiral stair is actually a set of platforms, with stairways and bridges connecting them. They form a rough helix which winds its way around the manor and up into the sky. The entire Estate is visible from here.
- Throne Room
 - A circular room, completely enclosed with the obsidian stone. Around the circumference are a few dozen mirrors, of all shapes and sizes. At the center is the throne, a massive chair of obsidian set with many times of gems. Hanging from the ceiling is a blue crystal chandelier. The floor of the throne room is part of the spiral stair. When the player steps onto the floor, the walls and ceiling start to form around them, completely enclosing it and leaving no exit. This will then trigger the fight with the [[Elite Guardian]]. After the battle, one of two things will happen. If the player smashes all the mirrors before defeating the Guardian, a path will open to the Study, but not back to the Spiral Stair. If the player does not smash all the mirrors, a path will open back to the Stair, and the entire Estate will start to crumble. The player will have a time limit to make it back to the entrance before the whole thing collapses into the ground.
- Private Study
 - A small study, with a bookcase, a fireplace, and a desk. On the desk is a withered corpse, presumably The Master. The Master is wearing the [[Gauntlet]], which can be taken.
- Bedroom
 - Not much here, except for a large mirror that hangs on one wall. If the player uses the Gauntlet on the mirror, they will step into [[Mirror World]].

## Obstacles
- Heights
 - Some parts of the chambers, specifically the spiral stair, are made of platforms suspended in midair. If the player falls off these platforms, they will fall to their death.

## Barriers
- The Seal
 - The Seal is divided into 6 parts. Each part must be activated with a different weapon for the player to continue.

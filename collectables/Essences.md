Essences come in two forms: free and crystal. Free essences are dropped by killed enemies, while crystal essences are collected from specific locations. Touching a free essence will restore 5 points of the corresponding resource, and collecting crystal essence will permanently increase that resource by 5 points.

Melancholic Essence is different from the others. Rather than corresponding to a specific resource, it increases the regeneration rate for all resources by 1 point per second. This effect lasts for 10 seconds. It is never found in crystal form.

## Sanguine Essence
free essence appears as a translucent magenta ball that hovers above the ground.
crystal essence appears as a twisted red orb with streaks of black, as though it was spun at high speeds.

## Choleric Essence
free essence appears as a translucent yellow ball that hovers above the ground.
crystal essence appears as a spiky yellow and orange ball with tips of the spikes turned upward, much like a frozen flame.

## Phlegmatic Essence
free essence appears as a translucent cyan ball that hovers above the ground.
crystal essence appears as a bulbous blue and white shape, like a group of bubbles stuck together.

## Melancholic Essence
free essence appears as a translucent black ball that hovers above the ground.
The rate at which essences will drop is inversely proportional to the amount of that resource that the character currently has. The maximum drop rate is %20, and the minimum is 1%. Melancholic essence has a constant drop rate of 5%. All free essences are thus very rare, and only serve to mix up combat by giving the character a slight boost. They are not the primary way to restore resources (regeneration is).

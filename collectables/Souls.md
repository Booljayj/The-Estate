In the world of The Estate, the soul is an energy field that is present within living things. It is composed of many different types of energy, called essences, in various proportions and patterns. Essences can be added to and removed from a soul to modify how it behaves. In general, the soul is what carries consciousness and the will to act.

The soul requires a physical matrix, like a body, in order to maintain stability. Without a functioning body, the soul quickly destabilizes and dissipates. It can take up to 30 minutes for the soul to fully dissipate, during which time it can still act on the world. If the freed soul comes into contact with a suitable body, it can often latch onto it and stay stable for much longer. However, because the soul was removed from its original body, it will still eventually dissipate.

The Master's work allowed him to manipulate souls in ways not usually possible. For example, binding a freed soul to a new body permanently, attaching souls to physical forms made of inorganic materials, and mixing two souls together. These would often include irreversible changes to the souls involved. For instance, a soul which has been made to permanently bind to a new body will not dissipate when that body is destroyed. Instead, it will linger as a free soul forever unless forced into a new body.

## Drops

Souls are dropped by enemies when they are defeated. Each enemy has a fixed permanent number of souls which they can give to the player each time they are defeated, and the player will receive fewer and fewer souls each time a specific enemy is defeated. For example, if a skeleton outside the crypts is beaten for the first time, it will give the player 10 souls. If the player comes back after that skeleton has respawned and defeats them again, they will get 8 souls. After a third time they will get 6 souls, and so on. After a certain number of times, the player will get no souls at all for defeating that skeleton. 

Souls can be spent at a Basin to apply certain upgrades to the player's equipment. Once purchased, an upgrade cannot be reversed, and the souls cannot be reacquired.

There is a maximum number of souls that can be collected during a game, which will allow the player to purchase 75% of all the available upgrades. This means the player must make lasting choices about which upgrades to get during each game.

## Pale Souls
Pale souls are dropped by most enemies, and are very plentiful. They are used to purchase upgrades for weapons. This can be anything, including increased damage, stronger knock-back, longer status effects, or lower resource cost. These can all be improved to 150%-200% of their original value once fully upgraded, and upgrades occur in increments of 10%. Higher level upgrades cost more than lower level upgrades.

## Lucid Souls
Some very strong enemies will drop lucid souls, which can be used to purchase weapon modifications. This will introduce new abilities for that weapon. Each weapon modification costs 1 lucid soul, and there are not enough lucid souls in the world to purchase all the modifications.

If an enemy drops a lucid soul the first time it is defeated, it will drop pale souls afterward.

## Roan is Born

Many decades ago, a small boy was born in a town bordering a large forest. He was called Roan, the same as his father, who died before he was born. Roan was a very unassuming boy, but he was always much smaller than other children his age.

However, Roan had something that most of the other people in his town did not: a brilliant mind. From a very early age, he began reading any books he could get his hands on. Whenever a trader or caravan came through town, his first thought was to ask if they had any literature. He read the great works by the natural philosophers of the past, including Pythagoras, Empedocles, Hermes Trismegistus, and Thomas Aquinas.

As he grew into adolescence, Roan became very aware of how different he was from everyone else. He was able to see the underlying structure of the world around him. He desperately wanted to understand everything about the world, while everyone else was satisfied with merely existing.

Around his 17th year, he stumbled upon a great discovery. By fusing the works of alchemists with modern knowledge, he found a way to extract an essence from one creature and transfer it to another. This allowed him to change animals in new and exciting ways, making dogs which grew feathers, rats which could breath underwater, and ravens which had antlers. He was able to tinker with the substance of life.

When the townsfolk caught wind of what Roan was doing, they were scared and outraged. They called for him to be burned at the stake for practicing witchcraft. Although he desperately tried to tell them about what he was really doing, in the end they ran him out of town, and he was forced to find shelter deep in the forest.

## Life as a Hermit

When Roan started living in the forest, he spent his days hunting and foraging, and his nights sleeping in trees. Over time, he learned to make traps and snares, which gave him much more freedom. He built a small shelter in a rock outcropping, which was camouflaged to hide him from wandering hunters. Some nights, he would sneak into the village to steal supplies, but over time he learned to be self-sufficient.

In his small hut, Roan continued his work. He began to understand more concepts about what he was doing, and developed some terminology to keep track of it. Living creatures had a sort of energy within them, which he called the Soul. The soul could be separated into different components, called Essences. These essences contained some part of what made each creature unique. By extracting essence from one creature and infusing it into another creature, one could transfer traits between these animals.

Roan's work was initially very crude, mixing traits between animals he could catch in the woods in a somewhat random fashion. Over a few years, he tried to categorize the types of essences, in order to find a pattern between them. As he refined his technique, he was able to be much more selective with what he could do. He created new types of animals that were highly intelligent and loyal, as servants to help him with his work. He could increase intelligence, strength, and lifespan in any animal he could capture. He created a pack of wolves that would hunt for him, a colony of squirrels that would act as sentries, 

Many years passed while Roan perfected his art. Around age 35, he started infusing himself with essences. He was very careful at first, only modifying himself a small amount to increase his stamina and strength. When no side effects appeared, he continued to change himself incrementally every few months. After a few years of this treatment, Roan was stronger and faster than anyone alive, and smarter than anyone who had ever lived. Additionally, he had greatly extended his lifespan and preserved his youth.

## A Monster in the forest

When he reached age 45, Roan reached a new level in his science. He started to manipulate not the essences, but the soul itself. This allowed much more drastic changes to be made, and an unparalleled level of control over the outcome. However, it came with a catch: not just any soul would work well. Simple souls, such as those in rats and deer, could be manipulated, but they tended to break down after a short time. The solution was simple: use a soul from a much more complex animal as a foundation.

Roan's first test subjects were dogs, since they had highly complex souls. He created dogs that resembled werewolves in form, to help him with his work. These dogs were capable of simple speech, and had dextrous hands. They were able to assist him in collecting more specimens to experiment on, and could stay with him as a pack when he traveled through the woods.

By this time, around age 50, Roan's work had become an obsession. Any obstacle that would keep him from understanding the deepest aspects of the soul was unacceptable and must be removed. With this in mind, he realized that the most complex souls he could find, which would allow him the most control and power, were those within humans.

Roan used his wolf pack to kidnap hunters that were in the woods. Once he had them captured, he would first modify them to turn them into mindless servants, who would do anything he said with perfect loyalty. These people were subjected to extravagant transformations, and as Roan played with their forms some did not survive the process. Over the course of 5 decades, Roan captured and experimented on hundreds of people.

While this was going on, the people from the towns that surrounded the woods began to grow suspicious. A few hunters going missing in the woods was tragic but understandable, but over the course of many years too many people had been lost. They began to tell stories of a horrible creature that lived within the woods, preying on anyone foolish enough to wander in. These legends came and went, as the people would forget and then be reminded of what lurked within the forest. Some were even bold enough to try and track down the beast, to make a trophy of its head. Of those, only a handful ever returned.

## The Creation of the Estate

Roan had spent an entire century delving into the deepest recesses of this thing he called the soul, and felt that it was time to do something grand. His home within the woods had evolved into a series of small camouflaged huts connected to a large underground system of laboratories, kennels, and workshops. However, with all the power he now wielded, he felt it was time to create a true home for himself. A place entirely his own, an oasis carved out of the woods. He made plans for his estate.

The first step involved creating the workers that would build for him. With his knowledge, this was a simple task, and he quickly had a force of hundreds of beings of all shapes and sizes. This workforce could do anything from lifting heavy stone blocks and carving tunnels, to engraving detailed murals and statues.

In his century of exploring the forest, Roan was familiar with every tree and meadow. He chose a location that was so deep within the woods that it was completely untouched by humans.

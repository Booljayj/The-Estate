## Early Life
Eric is the son of an English man, Jack Middleton, and a West African woman, Ngozi Chahine. Jack came from a fairly wealthy family, and spent many years traveling to unique locations to hunt dangerous animals. It was on one of these hunts that he met and fell in love with Ngozi, who was his guide. Ngozi had also grown up learning how to hunt large animals, and loved being in the remote wilderness. They lived for a few years in Africa, then decided as a couple to continue traveling around the world to find interesting game.

When Ngozi became pregnant, the couple decided to tone down their adventurous lifestyle and settle in England. Jack's parent had died a few years prior to this, so he owned the family home which they moved into. Ngozi had a difficult pregnancy, and although the birth was successful she was very ill from that point on. When their son, Eric, was 2 years old, she died, and Jack was left to raise his son alone. Jack never remarried.

Jack was a very loving and supportive father to Eric. Due to the culture at the time, Eric was looked down upon for being mixed-race. He didn't attend public schools, but his father gave him a full education. Additionally, Jack taught Eric everything he knew about hunting, and during Eric's adolescence they went on many hunting trips together. Eric eventually exceeded his father's ability to track and take down large animals, a fact of which Jack was immensely proud.

## Life Alone
When Eric was 17, his father became very sick and died. He was left completely alone, never having made many friends during his youth. He made the decision to leave the family home and strike out into the forests, where he could escape the pain of his father's death and the bigoted derision of the people in the cities.

Eric made a life for himself for several years traveling around England. When he could, he took up small jobs in remote villages to make a little money, which he spent on equipment and supplies. Around age 23 he started to take on bounties, using his skills to track down wanted criminals and bring them to justice. He gained a reputation as a skilled bounty hunter, and made a good life for himself.

During all of this, he continued to travel from village to village, hunting for most of his food in the woods, sometimes staying in inns and otherwise camping under the stars. Although he was sometimes lonely, he enjoyed the solitary life he led. It left him free to ponder the mysteries of life and practice many skills.

## Discovering the Estate
One spring when he was 26, Eric heard of a village on the edge of a vast unexplored forest. In this village, several children had gone missing over the past few years. Eric traveled to the village to learn more and possibly accept a new job.

The villagers gave Eric the full account of what had happened, including the tales of a mysterious creature that lurked within the woods. They offered what they could spare as payment for his help, which was a meager sum. Eric decided nonetheless to help the village, knowing how painful the loss of a family member can be.

Eric spend a week exploring the woods, trying to track down what had happened to the children. He suspected that the answer was fairly mundane, and that the children had been attacked and eaten by a stray bear. The proximity of the attacks was a tragic coincidence. However, none of the trails he followed seemed to lead anywhere, as if they were deliberately placed to lead someone astray.

Suddenly, after such a long time, Eric came across an ancient stone wall in the middle of the forest. There was nothing immediately surprising about this, as the forests of England sometimes contained the remnants of ancient castles and fortifications. However, when Eric attempted to go around the wall, he found that it formed a perfect enclosure, around a mile in diameter.

Eric climbed a tree to get a glimpse of what lay within the wall (he would have climbed the wall itself, but it looked as though it would crumble at any moment). All that he saw was more forest, nothing of interest. This of course greatly piqued his interest, so he resolved to find a way inside. From his vantage point he could see what looked like an entrance, so he headed towards it.

## Inside the Estate
The entrance was a set of wooden double doors, very large and very old, yet still intact. As he pushed the door open and stepped inside, he was momentarily blinded by a flash of light. When he recovered, he was met with an astonishing sight. In front of him was not an uninteresting patch of forest, but a lavish and meticulously detailed estate. From where he was standing, he could see a driveway connected to a large manor, a set of greenhouses to the left, and a hill with a small chapel on the right.

He took a moment to take in all that he was seeing, and in that moment he was hit by a massive blast of wind that knocked him back into the doors. The doors shut with a loud bang, and Eric dropped to the ground, stunned for a few moments.

After determining that he was not badly injured, he stood up and tried to figure out what had happened. Trying the doors behind him, he found that they were tightly shut and would not open. Looking around, he didn't see anything different from before.

Eric resolved to head into the manor in front of him, thinking that whatever this strange place was, it must have something to do with the children that had gone missing.
